# 1. Welcome

This came about because I found so few other starters had the meat of what I wanted to start with.  This starter will allow you to get started with the content portion of your gatsby site more quickly than many others.

If you wish to create new markdown files the site will throw an error on that case.  You will need to restart the gatsby tools after you create each markdown file.

Pull in images from the assets folder.
